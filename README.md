Based on my research the best time to begine startups would be on May or june.
Campaign pledges for Musicals in Great Britain are too low for a 4,000 pound goal a better option would be a 2,000 pound goal. 
My recommendation is to begin a play kicksterter in May in order to have the highest chance of success.
